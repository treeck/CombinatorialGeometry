The range of possible surjective (many-to-one) mappings from every
disjoint domain set of same-sized subintervals of a domain interval
to a corresponding image (distance) set containing the same
number of same-sized subintervals, where the distance sets
sometimes intersect, converges to the triangle inequality and
converges to taxicab (Manhattan) distance at the upper boundary
and Euclidean distance at the lower boundary, which provides a
set-based foundation for the definitions of metric space, longest,
and shortest distance measures.
A surjective definition of countable size converges to the product
of interval sizes used in the Lebesgue measure and Euclidean
integrals.
A cyclic set of at most 3 dimensions emerges from the same
surjective relations generating distance and volume.
Four-vector lengths, like the spacetime four-vector length,
are derived from two dimensional Euclidean distance equations.
Proofs are verified in Coq.
