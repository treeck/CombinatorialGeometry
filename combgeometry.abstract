Applying a ruler-like measure to the definition of a countable distance space,
where for each disjoint domain set there exists a corresponding same-sized
range set and the range sets in some cases intersect, converges to: the
triangle inequality and non-negativity properties of metric space, Manhattan
distance at the upper boundary, and Euclidean distance at the lower boundary.
Applying the ruler-like measure to a set-based definition of countable volume
converges to the product of interval interval sizes (Euclidean area/volume).
The total order and symmetry properties of these two countable set-based
distance and volume definitions limit an Euclidean geometry to 3 dimensions.
Proofs are verified in Coq.
