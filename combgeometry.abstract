A ruler-like measure divides sets of domain and range intervals approximately
into countable sets of same-sized subintervals.
As the subinterval size converges to zero: 1) The countable distance spanning
disjoint domain sets is the union size of range sets, where for each domain set
there exists a corresponding same-sized range set, converges to: the triangle
inequality, Manhattan distance at the upper boundary and Euclidean distance at
the lower boundary of the triangle inequality.
2) The Cartesian product of the countable number of members in each domain set
converges to the product of interval interval sizes (Euclidean area/volume).
All proofs are verified in Coq.
