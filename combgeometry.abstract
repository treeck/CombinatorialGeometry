Applying a ruler-like measure to domain-to-range set mappings, where for
each disjoint domain set there exists a corresponding same-sized range set
and the range sets in some cases intersect, generates all the properties of
metric space, and converges to Manhattan distance at the upper boundary
and Euclidean distance at the lower boundary of the triangle inequality.
Applying the ruler-like measure to a domain-to-domain set mapping converges
to the product of interval interval sizes (Euclidean area/volume).
The ordered and symmetric properties of the set-based distance and
volume relations limit an Euclidean geometry to 3 dimensions.
